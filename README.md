# closest-schools

This project was a programming assignment given to me in my CS 302 Algorithms and Complexity course. With the guidance of psuedo code we wrote together in class, I implemented a closest point algorithm using divide and conquer in O(n log n) time. This closest point algorithm was applied to finding the two closest schools in Vermont. More details on this context for the project is below. 

"The number of school-aged children in Vermont has been falling, and it is getting expensive to keep open schools that have only a few students. To deal with this, many towns are consolidating schools (combining students in two neighboring towns into one school). Data on K-12 school locations is publicly available via the Vermont Open Geodata Portal. In this assignment, you will write a program that finds the closest pair of K-12 schools in Vermont. This program could be used to suggest schools as candidates for mergers." (Taken directly from our guidelines)
